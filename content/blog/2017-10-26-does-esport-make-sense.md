I have received credit from you and I will try not to disappoint you. I hope you will find the entries valuable. :-) . The topics are very broad but we concentrate on the players. Those who treat games only and exclusively entertaining. But also in business terms.

However, if it ever turns out that you will be a different sentence, please write to me either in a comment or privately to my email address.  I would be very grateful if you would like to join the discussion under the entries on my blog. I try to answer these questions on an ongoing basis. - but of course only the ones I know the answer to :) Thank you again for being on my blog and I hope that this decision will have a positive impact on your life and investment.

I want you to spend your free time as much as possible even playing computer games. Times have changed. Streaming, Analyzed. Playing on the sports scene.All this paradox is a very big chance. Don't waste it! - This is what I wish you. :)  . The next entry will be about the world of esport. Does it have a proper (Deep) sense?
